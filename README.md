# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
Diabetes is among the most prevalence chronic diseases in the world. Data set given in the diabetes-dataset.csv is a clean data set of 100,000 survey responses, provided by the author Mohammed Mustafa.

## The description on a few variables is given below.
- hypertension: 0 = No; 1 = Yes
- heart_diease: 0= No; 1 = Yes
- smoking_history:
  - current = currently is smoking;
  - ever = smoked sometimes but not often;
  - former = smoked before but has completely quitted;
  - never = never before and after;
  - not current = before not smoking but not sure for future
- gender = Female, Male and Other (LGBT)

## Purpose of this assignment:
Write a statistical report to show your work on choosing a classication method for predicting diabetes status; and propose the best classier. Investigate on the goodness of of the classiers.

## Suggestion for the main part of the report
Part I Exploring the data set
1. You should summarize/describe the response variable as well as input variables.
2. You should check the association between the response and each input variable before fitting any models/classier. Comment on the strength of the association. This step is to identify the potential features for the model/classier.
3. It is advised to separate the full data set into two parts for training and for testing with the ratio of 8:2, respectively.

# Part II Building Model/Classier and Conclusion
1. Propose some models/classiers.
2. For each model/classier, examine its goodness of t: by ROC and AUC, and at least one of the 5 metrics introduced in Topic 4.
3. Comparing the goodness of t between models/classiers tted, propose the best one (final model).
4.  Comments on pros and cons of each model fitted.
5.   You might consider (optional) to use N-fold CV to nd the best value for parameter in the model you fit (such as best k for KNN; or best cp or minsplit for decision tree.)

## Few Notes
1. Each student must report your work on at least three dierent models/classiers.
2. Dierent student might have dierent choice for the nal model. However, you need to justify your choice clearly.
   
### Format of the report
1. Your report is a .pdf le, limited to no more than SIX printing pages, font size 12.
2. Table and/or gure in the report should be numbered clearly.
3. If you submit the report without submitting R code le, your mark will be deducted by half of the mark given to your report.
4. If you add any R code into your report, it will still be counted within the six pages allowed.

Hence, it's advised not to add R code into your report.
